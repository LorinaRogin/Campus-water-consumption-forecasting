# Campus Water Consumption Forecasting

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes campus water consumption data to identify usage patterns and forecast future trends. The dataset used in this project was sourced from **Kaggle** and is intended **only for learning and analytical purposes**, not as real campus data.

##  Objectives

* Analyze historical water consumption patterns
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Apply forecasting techniques to predict future water usage
* Understand the role of data analytics in sustainability planning

##  Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Note:** The dataset does not represent actual campus water consumption and is used strictly for educational analysis.

##  Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Basic forecasting techniques

## Key Outcomes

* Clear visualization of water usage trends
* Insights into consumption behavior
* Forecasted water demand based on historical data

##  Use Case

This project demonstrates how data analytics and forecasting can support sustainability initiatives and resource planning in a campus-like environment.
